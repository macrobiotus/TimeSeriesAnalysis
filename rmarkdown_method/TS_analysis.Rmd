## Create TimeSeries object

This code chunk first checks if a timeseries object has been saved, if that is the 
case, the object is loaded instead of being created again. To reset this analysis, the
saved timeseries object should be deleted or moved from the repository.  
If no timeseries object was found, the code chunk creates the timeseries object 
using the parameters defined above. The raw matrix is also created using the second function  

```{r create_base_TS, message=FALSE}
if(obj_name %in% list.files(name_result_folder)==FALSE){
TS_object <- new('TimeSeries_Object',
                 group_names=my_group_names,group_colors=graphic_vector,DE_method=diff_exp_type,
                 DE_p_filter=p_val_filter_type,DE_p_thresh=p_thresh,DE_l2fc_thresh=l2fc_thresh,
                 PART_l2fc_thresh=PART_l2fc,sem_sim_org=org_sem_sim,Gpro_org=my_org_gpro)

# TS_object <- TS_load_example_data(TS_object,'PBMC')
TS_object <- add_experiment_data(TS_object,sample_dta_path=my_path_sample_dta,count_dta_path=my_path_data)
TS_object <- add_semantic_similarity_data(TS_object,my_ont_sem_sim)
}else{
  load(name_save_obj)
}

```

## Differental gene expression analysis

Loads the necessary functions to perform differential gene expression analysis
If the tool used is DESeq2[@love2014moderated], the data needs to be normalized using it's method.
If the tool used is limma[@smyth2005limma], the normalized matrix should have been inputed, and
thus no normalization is needed.

This code chunk performs both the conditional and temporal differential gene expression
and saves the results within the Time Series object. 

```{r run_DE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Perform normalization if the DESeq2 tool is being used and if normalized matrix doesn't exist
if (slot(TS_object,'DE_method')=='DESeq2' & 'norm' %in% names(assays(slot(TS_object,'exp_data')))!=TRUE){
  TS_object <- normalize_timeSeries_with_deseq2(time_object=TS_object)
}

#Perform conditional differential gene expression analysis
TS_object <- conditional_DE_wrapper(TS_object)
#Perform temporal differential gene expression analysis
TS_object <- temporal_DE_wrapper(TS_object, do_all_combinations = do_all_temporal_comparisons)

#save the timeseries object
save(TS_object, file = name_save_obj)

# check Time series object
dplyr::glimpse(TS_object)
TS_object@DE_results$conditional
TS_object@DE_results$temporal

TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_15_vs_TP_0$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 5
TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_30_vs_TP_15$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 1
TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_60_vs_TP_30$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 0
TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_120_vs_TP_60$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 0 
TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_240_vs_TP_120$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 0 
TS_object@DE_results$temporal$TP_480_vs_TP_240$DE_sig_data |> nrow() # 1

```

## PART clustering
The code chunk below prepares and initiates PART clustering[@nilsen2013identifying].
It first retrieves the number of significant genes for PART clustering in the 'signi_genes' variable
This chunk can be quite lengthy depending on the number of genes included
for clustering as well as the number of recursions set for the clustering

```{r run_PART, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = TRUE}
#Extract genes for PART clustering based on defined log(2)foldChange threshold
signi_genes <- select_genes_with_l2fc(TS_object)

sample_data <- exp_sample_data(TS_object)

# Use all samples, but implement a custom order. In this case it is reversed
samps_2 <- sample_data$sample[sample_data$group==TS_object@group_names[2]]
samps_1 <- sample_data$sample[sample_data$group==TS_object@group_names[1]]

# Create the matrix that will be used for PART clustering
TS_object <- prep_counts_for_PART(object=TS_object,target_genes=signi_genes,
                                     scale=TRUE,target_samples=c(samps_2,samps_1))

#Sets a seed for reproducibility
if (is.null(PART_seed)==FALSE){
  set.seed(as.character(PART_seed))
}

TS_object <- compute_PART(TS_object, part_recursion = PART_recursion, part_min_clust = PART_min_clust,
                        custom_seed = PART_seed, dist_param = "euclidean", hclust_param = "average")
#Save the TimeSeries object to the directory to prevent loss of data in the event
#of a downstream error
save(TS_object,file = name_save_obj)
```

## Gprofiler analysis
The code chunk below runs a gprofiler analysis[@kolberg2020gprofiler2;@raudvere2019g].
IMPORTANT: This function requires that there be a stable internet connection
lack of connection or intermittent drops in the connection will result in an error
and the termination (stop) of the code chunk

If an error has occurred, this code chunk can be re-run separately from the above chunks
by commenting (removing the '#' in front) the "load('timeseries_obj_res.Rdata')" line.

This will load the results saved after the PART clustering code chunk

This code chunk will overwrite the saved object if it is completed. The overwritten
object will then contain the gprofiler analysis results and can be used to generate
plots with the downstream code chunks.
```{r run_Gpro, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = TRUE}
# load('timeseries_obj_res.Rdata')
TS_object <- run_gprofiler_PART_clusters(TS_object) #Run the gprofiler analysis

#Save the results in a Rdata object
save(TS_object, file = name_save_obj)

```


# TimeSeries analysis results

Most plots are created in SVG format for ease of editing with SVG editing software
such as InkScape (open source software). Some plots are created in html format
as they are interactive plots. These require a web browser to open them

To convert SVG files to PNG/JPG/PDF, this website is available: https://svgtopng.com/  
HTML files can be opened and then saved as PNG (or other) using the camera icon 
in the top right of each respective interactive plot


```{r results_setup, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, error = TRUE}

## Differential Gene Expression results

**DEGs found per analysis\:** `r kable(DEG_table)`  
Each experiment listed in the above table has separate results which can be viewed
in the 'TS_results' folder. In the main results folder, the differential gene expression
results are located in the 'DE_results_conditional' and 'DE_results_temporal' plot.  
Each individual experiment creates the following\:  
**DE_raw_data.csv**\: A csv file containing all the genes and their associated differential
expression results, regardless of significance.  
**DE_sig_data**\: A csv file containing only the significant differential expression results.  
**MA_plot.png**\: A MA plot, these are often used to evaluate the quality of the normalization.  
**volcano_plot.png**\: A volcano plot which splits significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes
as well as non-significant genes.  
**PCA_plot**\: A PCA plot using only the samples implicated in the differential gene expression analysis.  

The pipeline also creates two large heatmaps which summarize conditional and temporal
differential expression results. The heatmaps were created using the ComplexHeatmaps package[@gu2016complex].  
These heatmaps illustrate each experiment as different columns (distinguished by color)
while the rows distinguish the groups. Plotted in the heatmaps is the log transformed counts,
while the log transformed log(2)fold change is seen in a histogram at the bottom of the heatmap.
The number of genes in each experiment (colored columns) is indicated in the legend at the bottom
of the heatmap.  
In the case of the temporal heatmap, the rows are labelled 'experiment' and 'control'. The 'experiment'
represents the time points being compared while the control represents the timepoint which the 'experiment'
is compared against. For example, TP2_vs_TP1 would have the 'experiment' be TP2 and the control be TP1, 
while TP3_vs_TP2 would have TP3 as the 'experiment' and TP2 as the 'control'. Note that TP=time point.  

**The conditional heatmap**  

<!--`r knitr::include_graphics(paste0(name_result_folder,"/DE_results_conditional/custom_heat_conditional.svg"))`) -->

**The temporal heatmap**  

<!--`r knitr::include_graphics(paste0(name_result_folder,"/DE_results_temporal/custom_heat_temporal.svg"))`) -->

## Genes of interest results

```{r genes_interest, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "65%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
# Subset for genes in the analysis
count_matrix_norm <- exp_matrix(TS_object,'norm')
gene_matrix_interest <- count_matrix_norm[row.names(count_matrix_norm) %in% genes_of_interest,]
if(nrow(gene_matrix_interest) > 0){
  var_vect <- apply(gene_matrix_interest, 1, stats::var)
  selected_gene<-names(sort(var_vect,decreasing=TRUE))[1]
  target_file<-paste0(name_result_folder,'genes_of_interest/',selected_gene,'_trajectory.png')
  knitr::include_graphics(target_file)
} else {
  selected_gene<-row.names(slot(TS_object,'PART_results')$cluster_map)[1]
  gene_traj_dta<-calculate_gene_traj_data(TS_object,selected_gene,log_tp_traj)
  gene_traj_plot<-plot_single_gene_traj(gene_traj_dta,slot(TS_object,'group_colors'))
  gene_traj_plot
}

```
If genes of interest have been specified, the pipeline will extract the differential 
gene expression results, both conditional and temporal, for each gene requested, provided
that they are found in the count matrix. These data files, along with individual trajectory
plots are stored in the 'TS_results/genes_of_interest' folder. Below the trajectory of the
most variable gene is shown. If no genes of interest were submitted, a random gene is taken
from the differential expression results. Illustrated in the trajectory plots is the timepoints
on the x axis and the number of reads (RNAseq) or expression (microarray) on the y axis.  
Note that data files and trajectory plots are created for all genes of interest found, regardless
of their significance based on the differential gene expression analyses.

## Cluster results

The code chunk below create the trajectory plots for the clusters found by PART
Trajectories are first calculated by calculating the mean of each gene for each
time point using the available replicates. The mean value of each gene is calculated
once for each group (control/experiment). Afterwards, the genes are scaled in order
to be able to represent them on the same axis of values. Each gene is plotted as
an individual colored line', a mean line (gray color) is also plotted to show the
overall trajectory of the cluster. These plots were inspired by [@timeseriesexperiment]

The log_tp_traj parameter defines if the time points should be log transformed.
A log transformation of the time points is useful if the time points are not
evenly sampled through time. For example, two time points at 0 and 15 minutes, with
another time point at 24 hours (1440 minutes) will result in the first two time points
being very compressed and possibly indistinguishable from each other.

**PART result summary\:** `r kable(cluster_map_sum)`  

All cluster results are found in the 'PART_results' folder, within this folder you will find the following\:  

**PART_heat.svg**\: A svg heatmap of the PART result â€“ detailed below.  
**PART_heat_with_names.svg**\: The same plot as above but with sample and gene names included. These may not
be visible depending on the number of genes included as well as the length of the sample names.  
**PART_heat_cmap.csv**\: A csv file representing a 'cluster_map' which provides the cluster in which
each gene was sorted in as well as the color (in HEX code) given to that cluster.  
**PART_heat_data.csv**\: The z-score values used in the 'PART_heat' heatmaps.  
**Ctraj.svg**\: At least one, and possibly several of these files will be in the folder. This/these SVG plots 
show the trajectory of each cluster individually while being split by group. Meaning the trajectory
of each cluster is shown twice, once per group. Information concerning the cluster and group is shown 
in the title of each subplot. One example of cluster trajectory is shown below.    

**PART heatmap and cluster trajectory**  
In this heatmap we illustrate all the genes which were submitted for PART clustering.
Each gene is illustrated using a Z-score, which measures the number of standard deviations
that a gene has from it's mean. In essence it measures the variability.  
Clusters are shown as the colored bar on the left hand side of the plot while groups and timepoints
are shown as the colored bars on the top of the heatmap. PART heatmaps were created with ComplexHeatmaps[@gu2016complex].  
The cluster trajectory of the most variable cluster (`r target_clust`) is illustrated, with
the trajectory of the experiment group at the top and the control group at the bottom. The x axis
represents timepoints and the y axis represents the scaled mean expression of the genes. The expression
of each gene is obtained by calculating the mean between all replicates for each time point in each group.
The values are then scaled in order to illustrate their trajectory. The overall mean of the cluster is shown as a thicker gray line.  

```{r test,figures-side, out.width = "49%", out.height="49%", fig.width=3, fig.height=3,echo=FALSE} 
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) #set the parameters
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(name_result_folder,"/PART_results/PART_heat.svg")) #plot the heatmap
plt_clust #Plot the cluster
```

## Gprofiler results â€“ standard

The below chunk creates the gprofiler result.
Some parameters relating to the species and ontology need to be defined
the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) plots that will be generated by the last function
of this code chunk. Both versions of the MDS plots seen below were inspired by [@brionne2019viseago].  

The ontology needs to be defined for the MDS plots as well. Note that MDS plots utilise the 
semantic similarity metric which currently only supports GO ontology (MF â€“ MolecularFunctions, 
CC â€“ Cellular Components, and BP â€“ Biological processes).  These have been defined at the start.
The first function plots the standard gprofiler plots (gost plots) to the directory, and it retrieves
the information of the requested ontology into the GO_clusters dataframe. This dataframe
is then used with the semantic distance to create two versions of the MDS plot.

```{r Gpro_results ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Create standard gprofiler results
gpro_res<-gprofiler_cluster_analysis(TS_object,my_ont_gpro,save_path = name_result_folder,return_specific_cluster=target_clust)
GO_clusters<-gpro_res[['GO_df']]
sem_dta<-slot(TS_object,'sem_list')
found_clusters<-find_clusters_from_termdist(GO_clusters,sem_dta)

#Plot and save MDS and clustered MDS
MDS_plots<-wrapper_MDS_and_MDS_clusters(GO_clusters,sem_dta,my_ont_sem_sim,target_dir=paste0(name_result_folder,'/gprofiler_results/'),return_plot=TRUE)
```

Each cluster has it's own individual gprofiler plot, these are found in 'TS_results/gprofiler_results/figures'.
The gost plot for the most variable cluster (`r target_clust`) is shown below.  
These interactive plots show the results of various databases when queried with a list of genes.
More information concerning these plots and their various datasources can be found at the following link\: 
https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost  


`r gpro_res[['gost_clust']]`

In addition to the standard gprofiler plot, the TimeSeries pipeline creates Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
plots. These plots illustrate a custom selected ontology defined by the 'my_ont_gpro' parameter. The first MDS plots shows all 
the found terms of the specified ontology and distinguishes them based on the cluster(s) in which they are found.  
In a MDS plot, the distance between each dot represents the semantic similarity between terms[@yu2010gosemsim;@wang2007new]. This can be loosely
defined as the 'closeness' between terms. Semantic similarity takes into account many factors, such as the content
of the terms (genes which belong to it), it's associations to other terms, the similarity or lack there-of in function etc...  
In an MDS plot, the dimensions will be adjusted to fill the space with all the terms, therefor there is no set metric to measure
the similarity. The purpose of the MDS plot is moreso to help visualize different groupings (or clusters) of relevant terms.
Hovering the cursor over the dots will provide specific information for that dot (term)
```{r show_MDS_term ,message=FALSE,warnings=FALSE,echo=FALSE,out.width='100%'}
MDS_plots[['MDS_term']]
```
A second version of the MDS plot provides a nearest ancestor clustering approach. 
All terms found are brought up to their nearest common ancestor. Since these databases,
GO ontology in particular, have a tree-like hierarchy, we are able to find common ancestors 
for each term which may provide a broader view if too many individual terms exist.  
This approach does not distinguish based on clusters in which terms were found, meaning that
terms from different clusters may be paired together.  
The size of each dot in this approach is relative to the number of terms sorted in that common ancestor (dot)
while the color is representative of the dominant cluster in that common ancestor. For example, if an ancestor
has 4 terms within it, and 3 of those terms are found in cluster 1 (C1), the dot will carry the color associated to C1.  
Hovering the cursor over the dots will provide more information on those specific common ancestors.
```{r show_MDS_clust ,message=FALSE,warnings=FALSE,echo=FALSE,out.width='100%'}
MDS_plots[['MDS_clust']]
```

## Gprofiler results â€“ custom

Dotplots were designed to illustrate the top n term results for any single ontology.
In the below code chunk three different ontologies are demonstrated, GO\:BP (biological
processes), REAC (REACTOME) [@jassal2020reactome] and KEGG[@kanehisa2017kegg]. The 'target_top' parameter defines the number of
terms (from most significant to least) per cluster that will be shown on the dotplot.

All terms shown are considered to be significant, the 'top' aspect reflects significance
based on the adjusted p value. The adjusted p value is negatively log transformed in
order to offer a better visualization, with most significant being in red and less significant
(but still statistically significant) in blue.

```{r Gpro_results_alt ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
target_top=10

select_ontology<-'GO:BP'
GO_dotplot_wrapper(TS_object,file_loc=name_result_folder,target_ontology=select_ontology,top_n=target_top,custom_width=10)

select_ontology<-'REAC'
GO_dotplot_wrapper(TS_object,file_loc=name_result_folder,target_ontology=select_ontology,top_n=target_top,custom_width=10)

select_ontology<-'KEGG'
GO_dotplot_wrapper(TS_object,file_loc=name_result_folder,target_ontology=select_ontology,top_n=target_top,custom_width=10)

select_ontology<-'HP'
GO_dotplot_wrapper(TS_object,file_loc=name_result_folder,target_ontology=select_ontology,top_n=target_top,custom_width=10)

```
Illustrated below is the dotplot for the REACTOME pathway if it exists, otherwise it 
will show GO:BP or KEGG dotplots if those have been created. All dotplots created above 
can be found in the 'TS_results/gprofiler_results' folder.  
```{r show_dotplot ,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

loc_gpro<-paste0(name_result_folder,'/gprofiler_results/')
if('REAC_dotplot.svg' %in% list.files(loc_gpro)==TRUE){
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(loc_gpro,"REAC_dotplot.svg"))
}else if('GO_BP_dotplot.svg' %in% list.files(loc_gpro)==TRUE){
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(loc_gpro,"GO_BP_dotplot.svg"))
}else if('KEGG_dotplot.svg' %in% list.files(loc_gpro)==TRUE){
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(loc_gpro,"KEGG_dotplot.svg"))
}
```


## Ancestor query plots

Ancestor query plots were designed to query results relating to specific GOs.

This plot searches for children of the queried term IDs.
Pathways, such as GO pathways are hierarchically organized, so a single ID will
be associated to other IDs. For example, the 'immune system process (GO\:0002376)'
contains several 'children', each of these children is likely to have children of their
own and so on. If we use the ID for 'immune system process' this plot will find all children
grand-children great-grand children etc... of 'immune system process'. It will then
split the children based on the PART cluster in which they were found, these results
are illustrated in dotplot format. This is accomplished via the GO.db package[@GOdb_ref]

Several websites exist to search for GO ancestors of interest, 'AMIGO2' is one
and 'quickGO' is another.

A word of caution with this type of plot. It will always link terms to the most
upstream ancestor, so if the query contains two term IDs which are related to each other,
the plot will illustrate all results as belonging to the term ID which is the most
upstream (oldest/ancestor). Each ancestor queried for will be illustrated in different
colors on the dotplot.

```{r ancestor_results ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='100%'}
#Dotplot for terms relating to specific ancestors

#Check if analysis is required, if not, set to null or empty
if(length(target_ancestors)==0){
  ancestor_plots<-list()
  ancestor_plots[['MDS']]<-NULL
  GOs_ancestors_clust<-data.frame(NULL)
}else{
  GOs_ancestors_clust<-find_relation_to_ancestors(target_ancestors,GO_clusters,ontology = ancestor_ontology)
  ancestor_plots<-wrapper_ancestor_curation_plots(GOs_ancestors_clust,sem_dta,return_plot=TRUE,target_dir=paste0(name_result_folder, "/"))
}

```

Two formats are generated for the ancestor plot. The first is a MDS plot. The second
is a dotplot version. If more than one term was found to be associated to ancestors, 
the MDS plot will be created and can be seen below, otherwise only the dotplot will be created. 
The dotplot will not be created if no terms were found. The files for both of these plots 
can be found in 'TS_results/ancestor_plots'. In the MDS and dotplot alike, the color of 
each term represents the ancestor to which they have been associated and the size is 
proportional to the -log transformed adjusted p-value. In the MDS plot, the PART clusters in 
which these terms are found can be seen by hovering over each dot, in the dotplot version, this 
information is made available on the x axis while the y axis represents the terms.  

```{r show_ancestor_MDS ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
if(is.null(ancestor_plots[['MDS']])==FALSE){
  ancestor_plots[['MDS']]
}
```


## {.tabset .unlisted .unnumbered}
```{r,echo=FALSE}
if(nrow(GOs_ancestors_clust)>0){
  #Escape the colons (:) for better illustration
  ancestor_df<-GOs_ancestors_clust
  ancestor_df$ancestor<-gsub(x=ancestor_df$ancestor,pattern = ':','\\\\:')
  ancestor_df$term_id<-gsub(x=ancestor_df$term_id,pattern = ':',replacement = '\\\\:')
  list_ancestors=list()
  for(i in unique(ancestor_df$ancestor)){
    temp_df<-ancestor_df[ancestor_df$ancestor==i,c('term_id','term_name','group_name')]
    colnames(temp_df)=c('term ID','term name','PART cluster') #Rename for better legibility
    row.names(temp_df)=NULL #Remove row names for better format
    list_ancestors[[i]]<-temp_df #Add to list
    }
}
```

A interactive table is also generated in order to better navigate the results in the event of a 
large number of terms found for many different ancestors. The csv version of this data can be found
in 'TS_results/ancestor_plots'.

```{r,results='asis', echo=FALSE}
if(exists('list_ancestors')==TRUE){
  for(i in names(list_ancestors)){
  cat('###',i,' \n')
  cat("Ancestor name: ",ancestor_df$ancestor_name[ancestor_df$ancestor==i][1])
  cat("\n")
  print(knitr::kable(list_ancestors[[i]]) )
  cat('\n')
  }
}

```
```{r sess_info}
sessionInfo()
```
